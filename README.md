## About VideoPlayer
This project is using experimental VideoPlayer component from [JetBrains Compose Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/zh-cn/lp/compose-multiplatform/) <br>
It can be found at <https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform/tree/master/experimental/components> <br>
<br>
But it has some problem because it use vlcj in SwingPanel: [Issue 1521](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform/issues/1521), [Issue 2926](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform/issues/2926) <br>
